Compute the shortest path through a bathymetry grid that visits all
acoustic observation locations in order, while enforcing time-varying
depth constraints. The inputs are fomats are identical as for
Wahoo.jl.

## Arguments

- `bathymetry::GeoArrays.GeoArray`: Raster of bathyemtry, see Wahoo.jl.
- `acoustic_signals`: Collection of acoustic signal measurements, see Wahoo.jl.
- `acoustic_pos`: Collection of spatial coordinates, see Wahoo.jl.
- `depth_signals`: Vector of depths measurements, see Wahoo.jl.

- `goal_tol::Int = 0`: tolerance for reaching each acoustic target location measured in pixels.
                       Controls the receiver range.
- `reltol::Float64 = 0.1`: Relative tolerance for depth measurements
- `abstol::Float64 = 0.0`: Absolute tolerance for depth measurements


## Return Values
- `path::Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}`: The coordinates defining the path for each time step.
                                           Time steps for which no path was found hold `(NaN, NaN)`.
- `path_length`: total (spatial) length of the found path.
- `costs`: total cost of the found path.
